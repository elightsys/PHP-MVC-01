# Welcome to the PHP MVC Framework (Step 01)

## About This Project
This project provides a step-by-step guide to building a custom PHP MVC framework. It serves as an extremely simple and beginner-friendly MVC skeleton application. The project is free, open-source, and ideal for those who want to learn the basics of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern through hands-on implementation. The tutorial is divided into multiple parts, each progressively leading to a fully functional PHP CRUD application based on MVC principles.

## Goals of This Project
- Teach developers the fundamentals of the MVC architecture.
- Provide a clean, minimalistic codebase that is easy to understand and extend.
- Demonstrate how to build a lightweight PHP application while adhering to MVC principles.

## Recent Updates
### Compatibility with PHP 8.2
The framework has been updated to ensure compatibility with PHP 8.2. Key improvements include:
- Refactored core classes like `Bootstrap.php` to align with modern PHP best practices.
- Transitioned certain properties (e.g., `$error404`, `$controllerName`) to static for better memory handling and simplified code logic.
- Enhanced method handling for controller actions and improved error management.
- Removed deprecated code and ensured the framework adheres to stricter PHP 8.2 type-checking and performance requirements.

These updates ensure that the framework remains robust and ready for future PHP releases.

## Technologies Used
- **PHP 8.2**: For backend logic and MVC structure.
- **jQuery**: For simplifying DOM manipulation and asynchronous calls.
- **Bootstrap 4**: For responsive and modern UI design.
